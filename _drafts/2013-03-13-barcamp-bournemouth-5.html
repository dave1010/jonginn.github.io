<p>After <a href="http://jonginn.com/2012/03/bcbomo4/" target="_blank">enjoying and speaking at Barcamp Bournemouth 4</a>, I decided to do a mad thing and <em>organise this years. </em>With previous organisers busy with new jobs and new directions in life, there was an opportunity for people to jump in. And I did. I <a href="https://twitter.com/jonginn/status/310165478779793408" target="_blank">am never doing lanyards again</a>.</p>
<p>Before this, the only event I'd organised was <a href="http://hackbmth.org" target="_blank">HACKBMTH</a> 1 alongside Adam @skattyadz. To go from a one-day hackday with 20 people to a weekend-long event with up to a hundred attendees is quite a jump. And I'm proud to say it went pretty damn well. And of course, it wasn't all me - I couldn't have done it without Tim @timofetimo and Paul @paulalbinson as well as the input from @tombuildsstuff and of course advice from @alukeonlife. Hats off to you guys. And of course @andytouch and @tombuildsstuff for bringing cake.</p>
<p>We had some worries beforehand. A lot of puzzle pieces needed to fall into place before the day would be a success, and luckily they all did. Some of them only fell into place days or hours before the event was due to begin. Initial planning for the event was rocky, with many organisers dropping out and leaving it up to fewer and fewer of us. I don't blame them, though.</p>
<p>But it all went brilliant. Everyone had a blast, especially me. My face was used in a game, in a HTML demo, and in God knows what else. We had a HUGE variety of talks, including one on Kennedy Space Centre, a Raspberry Pi Tank, social media storytelling, the fail swap shop, Kinect, and loads more besides. Every session was a difficult choice between competing things of equal awesomeness.</p>
<p>I also did a talk about CSS Pre-Processors, namely Sass, and my recent obsession with them. Many people left feeling like they were more prepared to explore the scary world of CSS Pre-processors.</p>
<p>Thanks to all for coming along. I'll post some pics up when I've got some. Here's some choice tweets from the event:</p>

<p><strong>Thanks to everyone for coming along.</strong> Of course, the event would be nothing without you guys and your brilliant, varied talks. THANK YOU.</p>
<p>And of course, thank you to our sponsors. <a href="http://bournemouth.ac.uk" target="_blank">Bournemouth Uni</a> hosted us, and <a href="http://bcs.org.uk" target="_blank">BCS</a> provided funding, along with <a href="http://freshleafmedia.co.uk" target="_blank">Freshleaf Media</a> and <a href="http://campaignmonitor.com" target="_blank">Campaign Monitor</a>. Without them it couldn't have happened.</p>
