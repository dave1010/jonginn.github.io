<p>I'm using <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> to run my personal site, and then using <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> to compress the CSS to new levels. As part of that, I want to use uncss to really kill off as much CSS as I can.</p>
<p>I couldn't find anywhere on the internet where someone had solved this, so I've managed to work it out myself. Somehow.</p>
<p>I'm not using Gulp to compile the SCSS to CSS, as currently gulp-compass isn't very reliable (and slow). If anyone's solved <em>that</em> problem, let me know.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/giakki/uncss">Uncss runs through your site</a> and determines what CSS you're <em>not </em>using - and <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-uncss">gulp-uncss</a> allows for that in gulp. However, as far as I can tell, the gulp version doesn't take URLs, only files or direct HTML input - which means Twig is out, as a typical twig site is made up of several template files.</p>
<p>However, using my limited knowledge of node solved the issue. Using fs (filesystem) and request, I go to the URL of the site (in this case, my local dev site) and download it as a HTML file, which uncss can then scrape.</p>
<p>To top it off, I then combine the media queries and minify the CSS, and then rename it to style.min.css.</p>
<p>Of course, this only really works for a one-page site, and generally uncss only works for a one-pager unless you've got a bulletproof styleguide page. I figured this might help someone.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Improvements? I'm sure you got 'em. Tweet me at @<a href="http://twitter.com/jonginn">jonginn</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br />
The <a href="http://twitter.com/ben_eb">author of gulp-uncss</a> got in touch to let me know that you can now pass URLs in an array to the html item in the uncss. So send it ['http://google.com', 'http://inbox.google.com'] etc.</p>
