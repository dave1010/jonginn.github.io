<p><strong>This week, I visited Normandy for 4 brief days to be part of the celebration of the 70th Anniversary of the D-Day Landings.</strong></p>
<p>I've <a href="http://ginnterest.com/2008/visiting-normandy/">visited Normandy before</a>, 6 years ago. It's not just a centrepiece in modern military history, but also the home of William The Conqueror and the Normans, the men who came from the North to settle in France and later conquer Britain in 1066 and transform our future. This combination of history both living and ancient means that there is something to marvel at around every corner.</p>

<p>Normandy is a gorgeous place. The weather was baking hot, especially on the 6th, and the atmosphere on every day was electric. The tens of thousands that came to Normandy were all incredible people and the local townspeople were lovely and inviting.</p>
<p>Getting the opportunity to meet veterans was, of course, the highlight of the trip. 70 years on, their personalities and character continues to shine through, and it was a joy to experience the 70th Anniversary with so many veterans.</p>
<h2>Off the Ferry</h2>

Right from the off, we walked out of the foot passenger terminal at Cherbourg and into a waiting ceremony. Of course, it wasn't for us but for a US Coast Guard veteran who'd been sailing on the same ship. This set the tone for the trip, one of respect and humility from the Normandy locals towards the veterans who had liberated them 70 years ago.</p>
<h2>Sainte-Mère-Église (June 4th)</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/DSC_0200-1024x301.jpg" alt="image" /><br />
First stop on our trip was Sainte-Mère-Église, essentially the holy grail for American paratroopers. The town was full of excitement and joy, with modern US Airborne solders mingling with re-enactors, all with townspeople and tourists alike.</p>
<p>Visiting Normandy was like slipping back in time - with a huge number of period vehicles on the roads and re-enactors, you'd be forgiven for thinking you were in 1944 itself. Heading to a T-junction only to have a 2-ton truck barrel past full of American WW2 soldiers is a striking - and common - experience.</p>
<p>The illusion of time travel is only affected by almost all of the American re-enactment soldiers actually turning out to be enthusiastic Frenchmen, Dutch, or even Germans.</p>
<p>During the US Airborne parachute drops at the start of D-Day, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steele_(paratrooper)">one paratrooper became stuck on the church tower</a>, hanging by his parachute. To this day a mannequin hangs there from his parachute to remember him.</p>
<p>That's just one story. The town (and Normandy) is full of them - just across the church yard there is a courtyard where one of the first paratroopers landed, captured by a German soldier only for the German to later surrender.</p>
<p>These little stories - moments in time - are everywhere in Normandy, and it's impossible to go anywhere without <em>tripping</em> over history.</p>
<p><em>This post will continue with more parts and photos from June 5th, including a jumble sale, tanks and ducks.</em></p>
