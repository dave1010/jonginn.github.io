<p>Because <a href="http://ginnterest.com/2014/a-week-of-events/">last week's roundup</a> was so well received, here's this weeks. You'll be glad to hear this week is far less insane, and therefore quite shorter.</p>

<h2>Monday</h2>
<p>A day spent on fixing blockers on one of our projects at Base. This project is one that's really exciting. It's the fruit of a lot of hard work from everyone in the team, especially our back-end developers, and it even has a codename which immediately makes it cool. It's so secret that I don't think I can say the codename, but I can say it begins with a... <em>W</em>.</p>
<p>I hate being one of those people that are all 'Secret things!' but this is one of those weeks. Fortunately, the two secret things are both mere days away from being finished. But that doesn't help this post now...</p>
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1163 size-medium" src="/assets/BmZEoQcCcAAtqHE-293x300.jpg" alt="Nexus 4, 5, 7 and 10." width="293" height="300" /></p>
<p>We announced some <strong>more</strong> devices for the <a href="http://odl.wearebase.com" target="_blank">Open Device Lab</a>, and they're all ones people should get excited about and want to get into the lab to test. We've now got a Nexus 4, 5, 7 and 10. We've got a Samsung Galaxy Gear. We've got a Tesco Hudl. We've got a Microsoft Surface RT.</p>
<p>All of these devices together (aside from the Gear) cover a large amount of people, and therefore should cover a large amount of your testing. The Hudl alone sold over half a million in the UK before Christmas last year, so by now it must be even higher. A really cheap tablet and <strong>everyone has one</strong> - so you have no excuse not to test on one.</p>
<p>You can book a testing session in <a href="http://odl.wearebase.com" target="_blank">Open Device Lab Bournemouth now, for free</a>.</p>
<h2>Wednesday</h2>
<p>Wednesday was a day entirely spent on development for another project. It was a really fun site to build, and another gorgeous design from our designer, Chris. There's not much I can say beyond that, but on <strong>Tuesday 6th May</strong> at <a href="http://bigdataweek.com/bournemouth/">Big Data Week Bournemouth</a> we'll be unveiling our work. It's a very exciting time for everyone, and I look forward to writing more about it soon.</p>
<h2>Thursday</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1162 size-full" src="/assets/65980daed16211e3886c0002c9df2e02_8.jpg" alt="Bournemouth Town Hall" width="640" height="640" /></p>
<p>On Thursday, <a href="http://twitter.com/tomatbase">Tom</a> and I went to Town Hall to discuss the project we'd been working on the day before. Our work with the council has everyone excited about the future, and what we'll be showing off on Tues is the first step in an exciting future.</p>
<p>Did you know that Bournemouth Town Hall used to be Mont Dore Hotel? And did you know that in the 1880s, the Mont Dore Hotel was one of the first places to get a telephone? It's phone number was... <strong>3</strong>.</p>
<h2>Saturday</h2>
<p>I bought this.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>
