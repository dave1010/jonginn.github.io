<h3><em>The tale of @horse_ebooks, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/status/192764283250151424" target="_blank">Learn</a>.</em></h3>
<p>If you know me, then you know I love @horse_ebooks. I often get a lot of questions along the lines of "What exactly is this bloody horse and why do you keep retweeting it?", so I thought I'd summarise it in one post.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>[tweet https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/status/227872728819052544 align='center']</p>
<p>@horse_ebooks is a spambot. There's no way around it - it's a spambot, a dirty dirty spambot. It's been designed to sell shitty ebooks and set up by some Russian guy. No one really knows what it is, and that's part of the fun of it. <a href="http://gawker.com/5887697" target="_blank">Some have tried to find out</a>, but it doesn't really matter. What matters is what it posts.</p>
<p>[tweet https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/status/213653374908903425 align='center']</p>
<p>@horse_ebooks attempts to promote and sell crappy ebooks by posting completely random snippets from them. By posting sentences completely out of context (and often with broken grammar/styling) it manages to make mundane sentences completely laughable. Often sentences are cut short abruptly, suddenly making a mundane sentence a complete mystery, and often with completely hilarious results. <strong>Every tweet is a real quote from a real ebook</strong>, which only makes it more hilarious.</p>
<p>[tweet https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/status/195109125233967104 align='center']</p>
<p>And it is consistently funny. Every tweet makes me giggle, and I have to resist retweeting <em>every</em> one.</p>
<p>I love horse_ebooks because it's utterly absurd. It's a bot that is fulfilling its purpose well but in a completely useless fashion. Absurd, insane humour is always welcome in my world, and horse_ebooks is the epitome of that humour.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you follow the account for a slice of bizarre, absurd fun on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>What runs horse_ebooks?</h3>
<p>Often under tweets you'll see the source, such as "web", "Twitter for iPhone", etc. In the beginning, horse_ebooks ran from the source of "Horse ebooks". At some point in September 2011, it abruptly changed to "web", leading to a lot of confusion. This change could mean that a real person is manually putting in the tweets, pasted from real ebooks. But the sheer volume of tweets and 'feel' to them doesn't seem right to me - it feels like a bot.</p>
<p>Either way, it doesn't matter to me. I don't need to know if it's a real person or a horse typing on a keyboard or a bot. It doesn't matter and I don't feel like I should have to find out. It would ruin the mystery and absurdity of it all.</p>

<ul>
<li>Something Awful's <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/twitter-horse-ebooks.php" target="_blank">post from a year ago</a> is worth a read to see how far we've come with our beloved horse. (We haven't.)</li>
<li>KnowYourMeme's <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse_ebooks" target="_blank">page should summarise</a> everything I've missed.</li>
<li>SplitSider's article "<a href="http://splitsider.com/2012/01/the-ballad-of-horse_ebooks/" target="_blank">The Ballad of Horse Ebooks</a>" is well worth a read too.</li>
