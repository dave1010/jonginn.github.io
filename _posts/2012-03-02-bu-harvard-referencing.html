<p>This file is intended to be used in Microsoft Word for the referencing function built into Word. It is intended to be used with the <a href="http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/library/citing_references/docs/Citing_Refs.pdf" target="_blank">Bournemouth University method of Citing References</a> and has been painstakingly edited to be as accurate as possible to the referencing detailed in that file.<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>To install on Windows, navigate to your winword.exe directory. Put the file in the BibliographyStyle folder.</li>
<li>To install on Mac, find Microsoft Word in your applications and select Show Package Contents. Put the file in the Contents/Resources/Style/ folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot offer any more assistance in using the file and creating a bibliography, although <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/create-a-bibliography-HA010067492.aspx">this Microsoft help file</a> should assist you enough. I recommend before saving your document out for final marking that you convert your bibliography to static text by right clicking on it.</p>
<p>While it is as accurate as possible, this referencing system <em>may not be perfect</em>. There may be errors, oversights, or incorrect formatting of references. If you notice any issues, please feel free to contact me. <strong>I cannot be held responsible</strong> for any errors in your bibliography. You should still <strong>double check your bibliography</strong>. This software is intended to make your life easier, not lazier. It is intended for you to be able to make your references better, make the marker's life easier, and allow you to concentrate on writing an awesome dissertation/essay.</p>
<p>If you are unsure what to do with the Referencing tool in Word, it may be best to do your referencing manually.</p>
<p>If you find this tool has saved you a lot of time, feel free to drop me a line on Twitter or email. Just knowing you've benefitted is a great boost. And if you're feeling especially generous, maybe you can buy me pizza. Or a cider.</p>

<p><strong>When referencing a TV show,</strong> select "Film", tick "Show All Bibliography Fields" and place "TV" in the medium category. Place the episode number (such as "Series 1, Episode 2") in the Comments field. Place the channel and date in the "Country/Region" field (such as "BBC2, 2009 Apr 1"). It's a workaround, but it works. I will fix this in a future update, maybe.</p>
