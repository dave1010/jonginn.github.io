<p><strong>Spoiler alert! </strong>Here are some very quick thoughts on The Apprentice 2014's final (I finally watched it!) and how I'd completely turn the sale of tights on its head.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>At the end of the final, Lord Sugar says he's taking a "gamble" in picking Mark. As a product-oriented man, that may be true, but as a businessman it's an absolute no brainer. Mark can scale infinitely on a tried-and-tested business plan. It's kinda boring, but you can never blame a businessman for going for the safe option, especially with lots of money on the line.</p>
<p>Going into the final, I thought Bianca had it in the bag - her product met the needs of huge numbers of women in the UK (and beyond), it's a unique proposition - and it's innovative.</p>
<p>But she scuppered herself in pricing the product far beyond what any sane person would spend - £24 for one pair of tights. Even the final drop to £20 wouldn't see many women rushing to the shops to buy one. And that's kinda okay, because Bianca was angling for the premium market - but that's not what the product represents. It's a product for every woman.</p>
<p>Mark's winning words were "Absolute Customer Satisfaction", and Bianca should have taken a leaf out of his book - absolute customer satisfaction, and a pair of True Skin tights in every home. Price it appropriately so anyone could afford a pair and you'd have the audience of the pitch in united approval.</p>
<p>The pricing would be crucial - if people say they would pay £6 for a pair of tights, then sell it at £8. Bianca was correct in saying that her tights were a unique proposition, so the price can reflect that. At any rate, tights break all the time, so make a good product at a reasonable price <strong>and people won't think twice about giving you more money</strong>.</p>
<p>(Turns out Bianca actually plans to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/24/lost-the-apprentice-nude-tights-all-skin-tones">sell it at £8 after all</a>. I'm a good guesser!)</p>
<p>In the final, Mark had an immediate advantage - no physical product to sell. This advantage, of course, exists in the real world and it's one of the reasons why digital is so empowering for a business anywhere in the world. Across 15 shades, 4 sizes, and 2 materials, the sheer vastness of Bianca's product range is enough to give pause to any shop owner.</p>
<p>But we saw how easy it was to make tights when the team tinted a few pairs. While I have no idea if that's how you'd make them en masse, it offers an avenue to a truly unique business. This is 2014, and the internet offers a whole new way of looking at how you make sales.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1281 size-full" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-12-30-at-09.54.54-e1419933351224.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-30 at 09.54.54" width="797" height="435" /></p>
<p>The tights themselves are a disruptive proposition - they bring new choices for women of all skin tones. So let's disrupt how you'd sell them. First of all, work out a way to bring that magical skin shading detection device to any shop in the country. A customer scans their skin colour. You make a pair of tights just for that skin tone. Then you deliver right to their door.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> their order, so they can quickly re-order another pair when they need to. <strong>Price</strong> it right, so they will be happy to make you their only choice for tights. Make it <strong>effortless</strong> to order for the first time or the hundredth. Deliver<strong> quickly </strong>so customers know they'll have tights in time for an upcoming event.</p>
<p>There is your business - not 15 shades, but <strong>infinite shades</strong>. At the right price, why would any woman ever bother to buy any other brand compared to their own unique tights?</p>
<p>It's a license to print money. At least, I think so.</p>
<p><em>(I know nothing about tights, but I like to think I know about the internet.)</em></p>
