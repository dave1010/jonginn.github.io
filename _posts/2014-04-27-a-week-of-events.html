<p>This week has been an absolutely mad, crazy week. As you may know, <a href="http://redevelop.io">we're running a conference</a>. I'm lucky enough to run or be involved in a large number of events in Bournemouth, and redevelop is proving to be one of the most difficult things I've ever done. But it's exciting.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>Tuesday</h3>
<p>Luckily, I'm supported by brilliant people both within Base and without. On Tuesday, we invited some developer event organisers into the <a href="http://odl.wearebase.com">Open Device Lab</a> to chat about the conference and their thoughts, and their feedback was invaluable. I hope it's the start of more co-operation, and we're already seeing that with <a href="http://bwmeet.co.uk/">BWMeet</a> teaming up with <a href="http://barcampbournemouth.org/">Barcamp Bournemouth</a>.</p>
<p>Their feedback included how to get and choose speakers, including a code of conduct on the site for all, and other suggestions.</p>
<p>Inclusiveness is something that goes without saying - but as was recommended, it is a good thing to put it in writing. A code of conduct for attendees will be on the <a href="http://redevelop.io">redevelop site</a> as soon as I write it.</p>
<p>I'll also be rolling a code of conduct onto <a href="http://hackbmth.org">hackbmth's</a> site once it's ready. Like above, hackbmth is and always will be an inclusive event for all, and a code of conduct helps to emphasise that by setting it in stone.</p>
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/fully_baked">Dave Baker</a>, of <a href="http://phpdorset.co.uk">PHPDorset</a>, recommended I reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/miss_jwo">Jenny Wong</a> for advice of her view of how to run a conference and make it inclusive. Jenny has brilliant experience running <a href="http://phpwomen.org/">PHP Women</a> and <a href="http://phpnw.org.uk/">PHP NW</a>, among many other conferences. Chatting to Jenny was fantastic and her feedback and advice was invaluable - I hope one day to meet her.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jenny's advice and the invaluable feedback in the week, we turned our approach to speakers on its head.</p>
<p>We've opened up the floor to all speakers to submit their talks to redevelop, and I'd like to see as many talks submitted as possible.</p>
<p>Speakers will be judged on the strength and 'interesting-ness' of their proposal, nothing more and nothing less. I don't care if you're a woman or man or a desk or a chair, if you've got something interesting to say about development and the industry or if you've got an amazing approach to building a website or if you've got the teamwork workflow nailed, I want to hear it. You can find more info on the <a href="http://redevelop.io">redevelop site</a>.</p>
<p>I want to make a brilliant conference, and make a brilliant day. That's all. To this end, the judging of talks will be done by more than just me. More on that soon.</p>
<h3>Thursday</h3>
<p>I spent Thursday cooking up the next version of the <a href="http://redevelop.io">Redevelop</a> site, from Chris' gorgeous designs.</p>
<p>Tom also put the wheels in motion for Big Data Week - in just over a week in Bournemouth, <a href="http://bigdataweek.com/bournemouth/">we'll be having talks from big data scientists, councillors, and real users of the biggest data around</a>. We hope to give people a grounding in Big Data and how to approach it. I think I'll even be getting a little slot to show what <em>I've</em> been working on, which will be exciting.</p>
<p>We're also even running a <a href="http://hackbmth.org">hackbmth for Big Data Week</a> on May 17th. Both the talk and hackbmth are free.</p>
<h3>Friday</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1132" src="/assets/BASE22-1024x681.jpg" alt="BASE22" width="700" height="465" /></p>
<p>Friday was launch day for a <a href="http://redevelop.io">first wave of tickets for redevelop</a>, a figurative leap of faith from attendees who trust in our ability to pull off an amazing conference with little to no information at this time. We've already sold a load and I'm thankful to all of them for putting their faith in us.</p>
<p>Friday evening was a brilliant evening, as over 40 people descended on the Base office to try out Oculus Rifts and Google Glasses - 3 of the former, 2 of the latter. The conversations being made in the office and the people there were fantastic. We'll certainly be doing something like that again.</p>
<p>Events are difficult. But they are so rewarding. The adrenaline rush of running an event is like nothing else.</p>
