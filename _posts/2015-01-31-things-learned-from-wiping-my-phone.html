<p>In the last week my Nexus 4 became unusably slow, so I decided to wipe it and start again. Here's some things I learned.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/new-automatic-setup-assistant-android-50-lollipop">Tap &amp; Go</a></h3>
<p>This allows you to tap your NFC-enabled android against another NFC android you own. Seeing as I have my Nexus 7 already set up, I just booped it against the 4. <em>Absolutely brilliant</em>. The intention is that it brings over all your accounts - but honestly I couldn't tell you what it did.</p>
<p>It seemed to bring over only my Google Accounts - but I still had to put my password in for both. I couldn't say what it saved apart from spending 10 minutes syncing over Bluetooth to my Nexus 7. In an ideal world this would be the only setup needed, but it didn't actually do anything.</p>
<p>It may be limited due to my Nexus 7 running KitKat and my Nexus 4 running Lollipop. Lollipop added Tap &amp; Go, so I was surprised to see it even <em>worked</em> with KitKat.</p>
<h3>App Sync</h3>
<p>Because your phone's list of installed apps is regularly backed up to Google, you can restore from that backup. Using Tap &amp; Go didn't give me a choice of whether I wanted to do this, so it immediately started blasting <i>all </i>the apps I had on originally. No, this is why I wiped the phone in the first place. Dashing over to the App Store and hitting 'Stop' halted that.</p>
<p>In the Play Store, if you go to 'My Apps' and 'All', you can batch install apps by holding down and selecting them. Then it's a case of approving all of their access requests, and they'll start installing.</p>
<h3>Apex Launcher</h3>
<p>This time around, I wanted to try something different, and I'd had good experience with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anddoes.launcher&amp;hl=en">Apex Launcher</a>. It adds a whole ton of customisation to the home screen, folders, and app drawer. Double tapping on my home now runs Greenify and locks my screen, while swiping down anywhere on the home screen brings down my notifications. Swish.</p>
<p>I've replaced the Google Search bar at the top with a Widget from the gorgeous <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.weather">Weather Timeline</a>, and doubled up on my dock - I can swipe between docks for more apps.</p>
<h3>App Backups</h3>
<p>Apps are supposed to backup your data to Google, but almost all of the ones I tried did not. Of course, many use your Google Account anyway and sync their data elsewhere (like Trello) so that's okay.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts&amp;hl=en">Pocket Casts</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely&amp;hl=en_GB">Timely</a> worked brilliantly. After I logged in on Pocket Casts, it synced my account. Timely connected to my Google Account and retrieved all my alarms.</p>
<p>Other apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.mvilla.android.fenix">Fenix</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit&amp;hl=en">Reddit Is Fun</a> didn't save any of my old accounts. Pocket and Trello worked well, but that's by logging in with my Google login to have an account on their services. Instagram, Evernote, Snapchat all needed logins. <strong>No apps </strong>used <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html">Google's cloud</a> to save my settings except for Timely.</p>
<p>Resetting your Android is a long process of logging into lots of apps. In this regard, iCloud works very well - apps open almost like you never deleted them.</p>
<p>The worst bit? <strong>Tap &amp; Go didn't bring over my IMAP accounts</strong>, so I have to add those to GMail app manually. That's a real chore. Tap &amp; Go has the potential to be excellent, but I wouldn't miss it.</p>
<h3>80 Days</h3>
<p>No, IMAP isn't the worst bit. I realised only after I'd finished that 80 Days <strong>doesn't</strong> <strong>sync your game</strong>, and I previously was in the middle of an amazing adventure around the world, down Africa, along the Philippines, across the Amazon, and approaching Dakar. Lost. I was on track to be back in London in 55 days, my new record. All gone. :'(</p>
